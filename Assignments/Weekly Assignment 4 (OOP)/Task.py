"""
In this assignment, you will design a new pavilion inspired by an existing pavilion or project (it does not have to be an ITECH pavilion :D).

You will use object-oriented programming. The components of the pavilion (e.g. columns, beams, roofs, walls) will be modelled as classes and subclasses.
Each component will have parameters (such as dimensions, material type, fabrication methods) that can influence the overall cost and CO2 emissions of the pavilion.
In addition, cost estimates will be updated based on design decisions such as material selection or changes in dimensions.

1. Create the pavilion class. This is the main class that contains the components of the pavilion and provides methods for estimating the total cost, carbon footprint, etc. 
2. Component classes: Each major component (e.g. column, beam, wall) should have its own class that calculates its individual cost, carbon footprint, etc. 
3. Material subclasses: Materials will have different costs and properties that will affect those of the components. 
4. Be creative
5. Upload your assignment to ILIAS and GitHub

the user should be prompted to choose the material
