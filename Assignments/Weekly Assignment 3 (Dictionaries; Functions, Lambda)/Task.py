Assignment 3: Building Information Modeling (BIM) Tool

Imagine you are developing a Building Information Modeling (BIM) Tool that stores information about different building elements.
Your task is to create a Python program that interacts with the user to collect and analyse data using dictionaries, built-in functions, UDFs or lambda. 
The program should perform the following tasks:

1.  Create a dictionary called building_elements that will store information about various building elements.
Each element should be identified by a unique key (e.g., a string or integer).
The value associated with each key should be another dictionary containing the following information: type, room, length, height, thickness.

key: The unique key for the element. (e.g. InW.01.23)
type: The type of the building element. (e.g., "wall," "window," "door," etc.).
room: The name of the room assigned to the building element. (e.g. "living room", "staircase" etc. )
length: The length of the element in meters.
height: The height of the element in meters.
thickness: The width of the element in meters.

2. Create a function called add_element that allows users to add a new building element to the building_elements dictionary.
This function should contained the previous contained parameters:

3. Create a function called calculate_area that calculates and returns the area of a building element in m2.
Create a function called calculate_volume that calculates and returns the volume of a building element in m3.
The above two functions should take a key as a parameter and use the information from the building_elements dictionary to perform the calculations.

4. Create a function called get_elements_by_type that takes a type (e.g., "wall," "window," "door") as a parameter and
returns a list of keys for all building elements of that specific type.
