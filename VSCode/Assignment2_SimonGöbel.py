"""
You can find a brief explanation of my code in the commentaries next to the code.
I gained a lot of understandment about the difference between tuples, sets and lists and how to use them.
Also i learned a bit about data management and how to use for and while loops. 
In total i think this assignment helped me a lot to understand the basics of coding in python better :)
